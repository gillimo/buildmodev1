# BuildMode v1 (Historical)


Mission Learning Statement
- Mission: Prototype a CLI‑piped coding assistant for local development workflows.
- Learning focus: command synthesis, prompt orchestration, and early tool-loop design.
- Project start date: 2023-10-01 (original release window)

## Overview
BuildMode v1 was an early attempt to wire a coding assistant directly into CLI workflows.
It became obsolete once newer agent tools (e.g., Codex/Claude-style workflows) matured.

## Capability Note
- Passed a junior-developer test: produces a working GUI calculator.

## Quickstart
```bash
python buildmodev1.py
```

## Environment
Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your shell or use a local `env.txt` (gitignored).
